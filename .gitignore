!.vs/launch.vs.json

# Since the VS CMake tools just use this directory, this is the only rule we *need* to have.
/out

# .. But we also ignore /build as many people use that as their directory for out-of-tree CMake building.
/build

# Ignore raw release trees.
# /out/install/TARGET is used now, so we don't need this anymore

# As well as their compressed equlivants.
